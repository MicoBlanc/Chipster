import ChipsterExample2 from "../../../components/ChipsterExample2"


# Case Sensitivity

The `caseSensitive` prop determines whether the chip comparison should be case-sensitive when checking for duplicates.

## Type
typescript
`boolean`

## Usage
```tsx filename="ChipsterExample.tsx" {7} copy
import { Chipster } from '@micoblanc/chipster';

function ChipsterExample() {
  return (
    <Chipster
      caseSensitive={false}
      // other props...
    />
  );
}
```

## Notes

- When `caseSensitive` is set to `true`, "Apple" and "apple" will be considered different chips.
- When `caseSensitive` is set to `false`, "Apple" and "apple" will be considered the same chip.
- This prop affects duplicate checking when `allowDuplicates` is set to `false`.
- The default value is `true`.

## Example

Here's an example of how `caseSensitive` is used in the demo component:

 
<ChipsterExample2/>


In this example, `caseSensitive` is set to `false`, meaning that chip comparisons will be case-insensitive. This ensures that variations in capitalization (e.g., "Apple" and "apple") are treated as the same chip.
