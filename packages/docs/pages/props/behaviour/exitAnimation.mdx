# Exit Animation

The `exitAnimation` prop allows you to specify an animation that will be applied when a chip is removed from the Chipster component.

## Definition

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Type     | `string \| { exit: AnimationKeyframes }` |
| Default  | `undefined` |

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `exitAnimation` prop:

```jsx filename="AnimatedChipsterExample.jsx" {6} copy
import { Chipster } from '@micoblanc/chipster';

function AnimatedChipsterExample() {
  return (
    <Chipster
      exitAnimation="fadeSlideLeft"
      placeholder="Add items..."
      onAdd={(item) => console.log('Added:', item)}
      onRemove={(id) => console.log('Removed item with id:', id)}
    />
  );
}
```

## Notes

- The `exitAnimation` can be either a string (predefined animation name) or an object with an `exit` property containing custom animation keyframes.
- Predefined animations include: "fadeSlideLeft", "fadeSlideRight", "fadeSlideUp", "fadeSlideDown", "fade", "scale".
- When a chip is removed, the animation is applied before the chip is actually removed from the DOM.
- The duration of the animation is determined by the animation definition.
- Custom animations should follow the `AnimationKeyframes` structure defined in the component.

## Advanced Usage

For custom animations, you can provide an object with the `exit` property:

```jsx
<Chipster
  exitAnimation={{
    exit: {
      keyframes: [
        { opacity: 1, transform: 'translateY(0)' },
        { opacity: 0, transform: 'translateY(-20px)' }
      ],
      options: { duration: 300, easing: 'ease-out' }
    }
  }}
  // ... other props
/>
```

## Related Props

- [`onRemove`](/props/core-functionality/onRemove): This callback is called after the exit animation completes and the chip is removed.
- [`renderItem`](/props/advanced-functionality/renderItem): When using custom rendering, ensure your custom chip structure is compatible with the animation application.

The `exitAnimation` prop enhances the user experience by providing visual feedback when items are removed from the Chipster component. It's particularly useful for creating a more polished and interactive interface.
