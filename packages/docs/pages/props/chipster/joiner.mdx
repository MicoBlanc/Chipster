# joiner

The `joiner` prop defines which characters will trigger item addition in Chipster. It supports both single characters and arrays of characters, allowing flexible input handling.

## Type Definition
```typescript
type Joiner = string | string[];
```

## Basic Usage

```tsx filename="BasicExample.tsx" copy
import { Chipster } from '@micoblanc/chipster'
export default function BasicExample() {
return (
<Chipster joiner={[',', 'Enter']}>
<Chipster.ItemList />
<Chipster.Input placeholder="Type and press Enter or comma..." />
</Chipster>
)
}
```

## Custom Joiners

```tsx filename="CustomJoinersExample.tsx" copy
export default function CustomJoinersExample() {
return (
<Chipster joiner={[';', 'Tab', 'Enter']}>
<Chipster.ItemList />
<Chipster.Input placeholder="Use semicolon, Tab, or Enter..." />
</Chipster>
)
}
```

## Joiner Behaviors

### Default Behavior
- Default joiners are `[',', 'Enter']`
- Items are added when:
  - User types a joiner character
  - The input has content before the joiner
  - Validation passes (if configured)


## Important Notes
- Joiners are processed before validation
- The input is trimmed before processing
- Empty inputs are ignored
- Joiners work in 'free' mode only
- In 'suggestions-only' mode, joiners are disabled
- The joiner character is removed from the final value
