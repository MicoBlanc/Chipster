# onSelect

The `onSelect` prop is a callback function that is triggered when a suggestion is selected, either by clicking or through keyboard navigation. It provides access to the full suggestion data before it's added as an item.

## Type Definition
```typescript
type OnSelectCallback = (suggestion: ChipsterSuggestion) => void;

type ChipsterSuggestion = string | {
  label: string;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
  data?: any;
};
```

## Basic Usage

```tsx filename="BasicExample.tsx" copy
import { Chipster } from '@micoblanc/chipster'

export default function BasicExample() {
  const handleSelect = (suggestion: ChipsterSuggestion) => {
    console.log('Selected:', suggestion)
    // Additional logic here
  }

  return (
    <Chipster>
      <Chipster.ItemList />
      <Chipster.Input placeholder="Search..." />
      <Chipster.Suggestions
        getSuggestions={(input) => ['React', 'Vue', 'Angular']}
        onSelect={handleSelect}
      />
    </Chipster>
  )
}
```

## With Rich Data Handling

```tsx filename="RichDataExample.tsx" copy
export default function RichDataExample() {
  const handleSelect = (suggestion: ChipsterSuggestion) => {
    if (typeof suggestion === 'object') {
      const { label, data } = suggestion
      // Access additional data
      trackSelection({
        value: label,
        metadata: data,
        timestamp: Date.now()
      })
    }
  }

  const getSuggestions = (input: string) => [
    { 
      label: 'React', 
      icon: '⚛️',
      data: { 
        id: 1, 
        category: 'framework',
        version: '18.0.0'
      }
    },
    // More suggestions...
  ]

  return (
    <Chipster>
      <Chipster.ItemList />
      <Chipster.Input placeholder="Select framework" />
      <Chipster.Suggestions
        getSuggestions={getSuggestions}
        onSelect={handleSelect}
      />
    </Chipster>
  )
}
```

## Important Notes

- Called before the suggestion is added as an item
- Receives the full suggestion object or string
- Works with both keyboard and mouse selection
- Can be async without affecting item addition
- Triggered for both string and object suggestions
- Access to additional data through suggestion.data
- Independent of validation rules
- Called even if item addition is prevented

## Common Use Cases

- Analytics tracking
- Data synchronization
- UI feedback
- State management
- API calls
- Event logging
- Cache updates
- User interaction tracking

## With Custom Validation

```tsx filename="ValidationExample.tsx" copy
export default function ValidationExample() {
  const handleSelect = (suggestion: ChipsterSuggestion) => {
    if (typeof suggestion === 'object' && suggestion.data) {
      // Validate selection based on additional data
      if (suggestion.data.isDeprecated) {
        toast.warning(`${suggestion.label} is deprecated`)
      }
      
      if (suggestion.data.requiresLicense) {
        checkLicenseStatus(suggestion.data.id)
      }
    }
  }

  return (
    <Chipster>
      <Chipster.ItemList />
      <Chipster.Input placeholder="Select package" />
      <Chipster.Suggestions
        getSuggestions={fetchPackages}
        onSelect={handleSelect}
      />
    </Chipster>
  )
}
```
