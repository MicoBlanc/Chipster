# Get Suggestions

The `getSuggestions` prop is a function that provides autocomplete suggestions based on the current input value. It works in tandem with the `restrictToSuggestions` prop to control the autocomplete behavior of the Chipster component.

## Definition

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Type     | `(input: string) => string[]` |
| Default  | `undefined` |

## Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `getSuggestions` prop:

```jsx filename="AutocompleteChipsterExample.jsx" {7-11} copy
import { Chipster } from '@micoblanc/chipster';

function AutocompleteChipsterExample() {
  const fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry'];

  return (
    <Chipster
      getSuggestions={(input) => 
        fruits.filter(fruit => 
          fruit.toLowerCase().includes(input.toLowerCase())
        )
      }
      placeholder="Enter a fruit..."
    />
  );
}
````


## How It Works

1. As the user types, the `getSuggestions` function is called with the current input value.
2. The function should return an array of strings representing the suggestions.
3. These suggestions are displayed in a dropdown below the input field.
4. Users can navigate through suggestions using arrow keys and select with Enter or by clicking.

## Advanced Usage with `restrictToSuggestions`

The `restrictToSuggestions` prop can be used in conjunction with `getSuggestions` to limit input to only suggested values:

````jsx
<Chipster
  getSuggestions={(input) => 
    fruits.filter(fruit => 
      fruit.toLowerCase().includes(input.toLowerCase())
    )
  }
  restrictToSuggestions={true}
  placeholder="Enter a fruit..."
/>
````


When `restrictToSuggestions` is `true`:
- Users can only add items that appear in the suggestions list.
- This ensures data consistency and can be useful for controlled vocabularies or specific data sets.

## Use Cases

1. **Autocomplete for Known Sets**: Ideal for scenarios where you have a predefined list of valid options (e.g., countries, categories, tags).

2. **Dynamic Suggestions**: Can be used with API calls to provide real-time suggestions based on user input.

3. **Fuzzy Matching**: Implement fuzzy search algorithms in `getSuggestions` for more flexible matching.

4. **Contextual Suggestions**: Provide suggestions based on previously added items or other contextual information.

## Performance Considerations

- For large datasets, consider debouncing the input or implementing server-side filtering.
- Memoize the `getSuggestions` function if it's computationally expensive.
