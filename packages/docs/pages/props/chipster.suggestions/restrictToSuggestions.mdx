# Restrict to Suggestions

The `restrictToSuggestions` prop limits the input to only accept values from the provided suggestions list.

## Definition

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Type     | `boolean`   |
| Default  | `false`     |

## Usage
```jsx filename="ChipsterExample.jsx" {8} copy
import { Chipster } from '@micoblanc/chipster';

function ChipsterExample() {
  return (
    <Chipster
      getSuggestions={(input) => ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'].filter(fruit => fruit.includes(input))}
      placeholder="Type a fruit name..."
      restrictToSuggestions={true}
      // other props...
    />
  );
}
```

## Notes

- When `true`, users can only add items that are present in the suggestions list.
- This prop works in conjunction with the `getSuggestions` prop, which should be provided to generate the list of valid suggestions.
- If `restrictToSuggestions` is `true` and no suggestions match the current input, the user won't be able to add the item.
- This can be useful for creating a controlled list and ensuring consistency with your data.
