# onAdd

The `onAdd` prop is a callback function that is called when a new item is added to the Chipster component.

## Type
Typescript
`(value: string) => void`

## Usage
```tsx filename="ChipsterExample.tsx" {7} copy
import { Chipster } from '@micoblanc/chipster';

function ChipsterExample() {
    
const handleAdd = (value) => {
  console.log('Added:', value);
  // Perform any additional actions with the added value
};

return (
  <Chipster
    onAdd={handleAdd}
    // other props...
  />
 );
}
```
## Notes

- The `onAdd` function receives the added value as a string parameter.
- Use this callback to perform actions when a new item is added, such as updating state or making API calls.
- This function is called after the item passes any validation rules and before it's added to the internal state.
