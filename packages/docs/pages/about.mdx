# About Chipster

I made Chipster because I couldn't find an easy way to add multiple values to an input box. I was surprised that HTML didn't already have this feature, even though many popular apps like Google Drive use it.

This got me thinking, so I decided to create a flexible input that can handle many different needs. Chipster can be used for:

1. Multi-email inputs for newsletters, invitations, and contact forms
2. Tagging systems for content management and e-commerce
3. Multi-selection fields for filters and surveys
4. Custom lists for event participants and to-do items
5. Sharing inputs inspired by Google Drive
6. Collaborative task assignment
7. Recipient management for messaging systems
8. Invite and referral forms
9. Autocomplete for contact lists

Chipster is flexible, customizable, and easy to integrate.

Using Chipster, I'm hoping you can build faster and create better user experiences.
