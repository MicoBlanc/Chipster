# About Chipster

I created Chipster because I was tired of reinventing the wheel for multi-entry inputs. 

Back at my previous job, I constantly built custom components for complex input fields. It was a time-sink. I knew there had to be a better way.

Chipster is a versatile multi-entry component that handles:

1. Multi-email inputs for newsletters, invitations, and contact forms
2. Tagging systems for content management and e-commerce
3. Multi-selection fields for filters and surveys
4. Custom lists for event participants and to-do items
5. Sharing inputs inspired by Google Drive
6. Collaborative task assignment
7. Recipient management for messaging systems
8. Invite and referral forms
9. Autocomplete for contact lists

Chipster is flexible, customizable, and easy to integrate.

Using Chipster, I'm hoping you can build faster and create better user experiences.
